  <h2>Domains/Business Knowledge</h2>
  <p style="margin-top:35px;">In software engineering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_knowledge" target="_blank">domain knowledge</a> is <strong>knowledge about the environment in which the target system operates</strong>, for example, software agents. Domain knowledge usually must be learned from software users in the domain (as domain specialists/experts), rather than from software developers. It may include user workflows, data pipelines, business policies, configurations and constraints and is crucial in the development of a software application. Expertâ€™s domain knowledge (frequently informal and ill-structured) is transformed in computer programs and active data, for example in a set of rules in knowledge bases, by knowledge engineers.</p><img src="domainBusinessKnowledge.jpg" width="100%"><p>Communicating between end-users and software developers is often difficult. They must find a common language to communicate in. Developing enough shared vocabulary to communicate can often take a while.</p><p>The same knowledge can be included in different domain knowledge. Knowledge which may be applicable across a number of domains is called domain-independent knowledge, for example logics and mathematics. Operations on domain knowledge are performed by meta-knowledge.</p>
