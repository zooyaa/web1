  <h2>Math and Statistics</h2>
  <p style="margin-top:35px;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics" target="_blank">Statistics</a> is <strong>a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data.</strong> In applying statistics to, for example, a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as "all people living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal". Statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments. See glossary of probability and statistics.</p><img src="statistics.jpg" width="100%"><p>When census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole. An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation.</p>
